Inv-Alert is a tool that allows you to obtain a daily inventory of hostnames found in a specific ElasticSearch index.

# Applications
## Inv-Alert
Application that obtains the daily inventory of a certain index hosted in ElasticSearch.

Characteristics:
- Connection with ElasticSearch emulating HTTP or HTTPS. Allows you to validate or not the SSL certificate used.
- Use of HTTP authentication to connect to ElasticSearch (this feature must be enabled in the ElasticSearch cluster).
- It has been tested to work with the indices generated by Auditbeat and Winlogbeat.
- The inventory is obtained daily, at a specific configurable time.
- The inventory obtained is sent to a Telegram channel. In the sent message it shows the total of hosts added and removed compared to the inventory of the previous day.
- In the Telegram message, a txt file is attached with the list of hosts.

## Inv-Alert-Tool
Application that allows the configuration of Inv-Alert, as well as the management of inventories through a graphical interface.

Characteristics:
- Allows you to create and modify the Inv-Alert connection settings.
